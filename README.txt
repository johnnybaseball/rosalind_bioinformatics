This repository contains python code for solving problems on the rosalind
website:
http://rosalind.info/problems/as-table/

I began using this project as a way to practice my Test Driven Development
(TDD) and thought it might be worth sharing.

The directory structure is the following:
/src      <-- all the library files and the problem solution scripts
/src/test <-- all the files for unit testing and a README on how to run them
/data     <-- data files used in solving the problems

All feedback, comments, and questions are welcome.

Thank you,
John Secord
